# RedAmon single-host deploy

Provision and operate a full RedAmon instance on any Linux server (EC2, DigitalOcean,
Hetzner, bare metal) from your laptop, given only its **IP + an SSH credential + a domain**.

## What this is

`deploy.sh` is a thin remote driver around RedAmon's own `redamon.sh` control script. It
prepares a bare host, clones the repo onto it, drives `redamon.sh` over SSH, and wraps the
whole thing in an internet-facing security layer that `redamon.sh` deliberately does not
provide (RedAmon is designed local-only): nginx + TLS + firewall + host hardening.

**The security promise: one public origin over HTTPS.** From the internet only the webapp
UI (443, plus 80 for the ACME challenge and an HTTP->HTTPS redirect) is reachable. The agent
API, MCP servers, databases, orchestrator, and the reverse-shell catcher stay bound to
loopback. nginx proxies the webapp and (same-origin) exactly the four agent WebSocket paths;
nothing else on the agent is exposed.

### Quick start

```bash
cd deploy/single-host
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: HOST_IP, DOMAIN, SSH_KEY_PATH, OPERATOR_ALLOW_CIDRS, LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL,
#            ADMIN_NAME / ADMIN_EMAIL / ADMIN_PASSWORD
./deploy.sh init
```

First build takes **30-60 minutes** (Kali + agent images). When it finishes, log in at
`https://<your-domain>/` with the admin you set in `.env`.

## Prerequisites

**Local machine:** `bash`, `ssh`, `scp`, `curl`. Only for password auth you also need
`sshpass` (`apt install sshpass` / `brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass`). Key auth is
recommended and needs nothing extra.

**The server:** a fresh Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 box. You install **nothing** on it by hand -
`deploy.sh` detects and installs every prerequisite (Docker Engine + Compose v2, nginx,
certbot, ufw, fail2ban, swap, ...) idempotently. See "How the host is bootstrapped" below.

## Server sizing

RedAmon is heavy. `redamon.sh` enforces a hard **8 GB** Docker-visible RAM floor at bring-up
(effective ~7.5 GB after slack), aborting below it unless `REDAMON_SKIP_RAM_GATE=true`.

| Profile | vCPU | RAM | Disk | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bare minimum (core only, no GVM/KB) | 2 | 8 GB | 50 GB | t3.large | Passes the gate; slow/swappy. Keep swap on. |
| Recommended (core + occasional scans) | 4 | 16 GB | 60-80 GB | m5.xlarge | Sane default. |
| Full (GVM + KB + Ollama judge + parallel scans) | 8 | 32 GB | 100-120 GB | m5.2xlarge | Ollama alone needs ~5-6 GB while scanning. |

Budget **60 GB disk minimum, 100 GB for the full profile** (kali-sandbox ~12-15 GB, agent
image ~7-10 GB, plus feeds/models/DB data/build cache).

## The `.env` reference (every variable)

`cp .env.example .env`, then fill it in. Every key, grouped as in the file:

### Connection (CLI positionals override these)
| Key | Purpose | Local-only |
|---|---|---|
| `HOST_IP` | Public IP/DNS of the target. Required. | yes |
| `REMOTE_USER` | SSH sudoer (default `ubuntu`). | yes |
| `SSH_KEY_PATH` | Path to `.pem` key (recommended). `~` is expanded. | yes (never copied to host) |
| `SSH_PASSWORD` | Password-auth fallback. Needs local `sshpass`. Discouraged. | yes |
| `SSH_PORT` | SSH port (default 22). Also drives the host ufw SSH-allow rule and the fail2ban `[sshd]` jail, so set it to the port the host's sshd actually listens on. | no (shipped to host) |

### Repo
| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `REPO_URL` | Public clone URL. No token needed. |
| `REPO_BRANCH` | Branch to deploy (default `master`). |
| `APP_DIR` | Checkout dir name. Keep stable - it fixes `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, which redamon.sh uses for DB-volume detection. Do not change between init and update. |
| `REDAMON_VERSION` | Optional version stamp baked into images. Blank -> redamon.sh default. |

### Access mode
| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ACCESS_MODE` | `https-domain` (default) \| `https-ip` \| `http-domain` \| `http-ip`. See "Access modes" below. |
| `DOMAIN` | Required for `*-domain` modes; ignored for `*-ip`. |
| `HTTP_PORT` / `HTTPS_PORT` | Ports nginx listens on (and ufw opens). Default 80/443. Keep `HTTP_PORT=80` if using Let's Encrypt (http-01 always validates on 80). Change only when fronted by another LB/proxy that presents 80/443 to clients. |

### TLS (https-* only)
| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TLS_MODE` | `letsencrypt` (domain only) \| `provided` \| `self-signed` (ip only). |
| `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` | Required for letsencrypt. |
| `LETSENCRYPT_STAGING` | `true` issues against LE staging (not browser-trusted) while testing, to avoid the 5-certs/week rate limit. |
| `SSL_CERT_LOCAL` / `SSL_KEY_LOCAL` | `provided` mode: local paths (relative to this dir) SCP'd to the host. Drop files in `cert/`. |
| `SSL_KEY_PASSWORD` | Passphrase if the provided key is encrypted. |
| `HSTS_ENABLE` | Emit HSTS on https (default true). Auto-absent for http-*. |

### Access control / hardening
| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `OPERATOR_ALLOW_CIDRS` | Comma list. nginx allow-gate + ufw 443 source. Strongly recommended. |
| `SSH_ALLOW_CIDRS` | Comma list for ufw :22. Blank -> falls back to `OPERATOR_ALLOW_CIDRS`. |
| `GATE_MODE` | `ip_allowlist` (recommended) \| `basic_auth` \| `none`. |
| `BASIC_AUTH_USER` / `BASIC_AUTH_PASS` | Required for `basic_auth`. |
| `WS_REQUIRE_SESSION` | Default `true`. nginx `auth_request` requires a valid webapp session cookie before ANY `/ws/*` upgrade. Keep it on as defense-in-depth: all four agent WS paths now enforce a signed ws-ticket + a server-side same-origin check at the app layer (fail-closed when `AGENT_WS_TICKET_SECRET` is unset), and this cookie gate sits in front of that as a second layer. |
| `CSP_ENFORCE` | Default `false` (Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only). Set `true` to enforce the CSP after confirming the WebGL graph and xterm terminal still render. |
| `ENABLE_UFW` | Host firewall (default true). |
| `ENABLE_SSH_HARDENING` | Key-only + no-root login. Skips disabling password login if you deployed over a password (so you don't lock yourself out). |
| `ENABLE_FAIL2BAN` | sshd + nginx jails. |
| `ENABLE_UNATTENDED_UPGRADES` | Auto security patches. |

### Feature flags (map to redamon.sh)
| Key | Maps to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_GVM` | `--gvm` | Heavy; 10-20 min feed sync; the deploy rotates GVM's `admin/admin`. |
| `ENABLE_KB` | `--kbase` | Bakes ML embedding models (+~4.4 GB image). The real KB switch. |
| `ENABLE_KB_REFRESH` | kb-refresh sidecar | |
| `ENABLE_ZRAM` | `REDAMON_ENABLE_ZRAM=1` | Compressed-RAM cushion. |

`SKIP_KB` is intentionally **not** an input: redamon.sh derives it from the `.kbase-enabled`
flag it manages. Control KB with `ENABLE_KB` only.

### Resources / tuning
| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SWAP_SIZE_GB` | Swapfile size when host RAM < 16 GB. `0` skips. |
| `REDAMON_SKIP_RAM_GATE` | `true` bypasses the 8 GB floor on tiny boxes (risky). |
| `REDAMON_BUILD_PARALLEL` | Cap concurrent image builds. Blank -> redamon.sh auto-sizes. |
| `DOCKER_DNS` | e.g. `8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4` merged into `/etc/docker/daemon.json` if container DNS breaks. |
| `DOCKER_BUILD_CACHE_MAX_GB` | Cap the BuildKit build cache (GB) via `daemon.json` auto-GC. Blank -> Docker's default. `update` reuses but never prunes the cache, so it grows unbounded; set e.g. `30` to bound it without slowing incremental rebuilds. |

### Engagement knobs
| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `REVSHELL_TARGET_CIDRS` | Scopes the ufw 4444 rule to your RoE targets. 4444 is loopback-bound by default; see the Security posture section for how to actually catch reverse shells (tunnel, or republish + DOCKER-USER rule). |
| `TUNNELS_ENABLED` | Keep `false` on an internet-exposed host. |

### First admin (required for init)
| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ADMIN_NAME` / `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | The first admin user, created automatically during `init`. There is **no** app-layer login lockout, so use a strong password (nginx `limit_req` is the only brute-force brake). |

### Optional app config (appended to the server .env)
| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NVD_API_KEY` | Faster NVD lookups. |
| `KB_EMBEDDING_USE_API` / `KB_EMBEDDING_API_BASE_URL` / `KB_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` | Use a remote embedding API instead of the baked local model. |

LLM provider keys are configured in the UI, not here.

### Behaviour / safety
| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `INIT_FORCE` | `true` skips the typed `INIT` wipe confirmation (CI only - dangerous). |
| `BACKUP_BEFORE_UPDATE` | Reserved (pre-update DB snapshot). |
| `DRY_RUN` | Print the resolved plan and exit without touching the host. |
| `VERBOSE` | Stream full remote output. |
| `ALLOW_INSECURE` | Must be `1` to permit http-* modes. |

## Access modes

| Pick | When |
|---|---|
| `https-domain` | You have a real DNS name pointing at the host. The default and recommended. Use `TLS_MODE=letsencrypt`. |
| `https-ip` | Bare IP, no DNS, but you still want TLS. `TLS_MODE=self-signed` (browser warning) or `provided`. |
| `http-domain` / `http-ip` | Lab/test only. No TLS. Gated behind `ALLOW_INSECURE=1` and a loud banner - they invert the whole security posture (plaintext cookies/creds, no HSTS, agent WS unencrypted). |

Derived automatically from `ACCESS_MODE` (you never set these):

| ACCESS_MODE | Public host | nginx | WS scheme | Secure cookie / HSTS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `https-domain` | `$DOMAIN` | 443 + 80->443 | `wss://$DOMAIN/ws/...` | on |
| `https-ip` | `$HOST_IP` | 443 + 80->443 | `wss://$HOST_IP/ws/...` | on (self-signed warning) |
| `http-domain` | `$DOMAIN` | 80 only | `ws://$DOMAIN/ws/...` | off |
| `http-ip` | `$HOST_IP` | 80 only | `ws://$HOST_IP/ws/...` | off |

The agent WebSocket URL is **baked into the webapp image at build time**
(`NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_WS_URL`). Changing the scheme or host later requires a webapp rebuild
(re-run `update`), not just an nginx reload.

## TLS setup

- **letsencrypt** (recommended, `https-domain`): needs `DOMAIN` resolving to the host and
  port 80 reachable. The deploy stands up an ACME webroot on 80, runs `certbot certonly
  --webroot`, then installs the hardened 443 vhost pointing at
  `/etc/letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/`. Auto-renew is wired via certbot's timer + an nginx reload
  hook. Set `LETSENCRYPT_STAGING=true` while testing.
- **provided** (`https-domain` or `https-ip`): drop `fullchain.pem` + `privkey.pem` in
  `cert/` (or point `SSL_CERT_LOCAL`/`SSL_KEY_LOCAL` at them). They are SCP'd to
  `/etc/ssl/redamon/` (key `600`), md5-idempotent. The only way to a trusted cert on a bare IP.
- **self-signed** (`https-ip` escape hatch): generated on the host with the IP in a SAN.
  Browser warning expected. Not for production.
- **No TLS** (`http-*`): certbot is skipped entirely.

## Commands

| Command | What it does | Destructive |
|---|---|---|
| `./deploy.sh init` | Wipe ALL Docker state + the checkout, then build from zero. Auto-creates the first admin from `.env`. | **yes** (typed `INIT` confirm) |
| `./deploy.sh update` | Pull latest `REPO_BRANCH` HEAD and apply (diff-driven rebuild via redamon.sh). Preserves all volumes/data. | no |
| `./deploy.sh status` | redamon.sh status + `docker compose ps` + ufw + nginx -t + cert expiry. | no |
| `./deploy.sh harden` | Re-apply host hardening + nginx/TLS only (idempotent), no rebuild. | no |
| `./deploy.sh ssl-renew` | Renew (certbot) or re-install (provided) the cert + reload nginx. | no |
| `./deploy.sh down` | Stop the stack, keep volumes/images. | no |
| `./deploy.sh logs [service]` | Tail `docker compose logs -f` for a service (default `agent`). | no |
| `./deploy.sh revshell-open` | Per-engagement: expose `4444` to `REVSHELL_TARGET_CIDRS` via a host socat forwarder (fails closed on reboot). | no |
| `./deploy.sh revshell-close` | Tear the `4444` forwarder down and remove its ufw rules. | no |

Connection fields can be overridden positionally, e.g.
`./deploy.sh init 1.2.3.4 ~/.ssh/redamon.pem ubuntu`. Use `--env NAME` to select
`.env.NAME` for per-instance configs (`prod`, `staging`, a client name).

## Security posture

RedAmon's threat model assumes a local-only deployment with no anonymous internet attacker.
Putting it on a public IP invalidates that, so the deploy closes the gap:

- Parts of the agent REST API remain **unauthenticated** (the whole `/workspace/*` family,
  `/sessions/*`, `/files`, FastAPI `/docs` + `/openapi.json`); `/graph/exec` and
  `/emergency-stop-all` now require `require_internal_auth` (wave 2). All four WS paths now
  enforce a signed ws-ticket + a server-side same-origin check and **fail closed** when
  `AGENT_WS_TICKET_SECRET` is unset - including `/ws/kali-terminal` (the root PTY) and the two
  cypherfix sockets that clone repos / edit code. The deploy still treats the agent as fully
  untrusted from the edge:
  - nginx proxies **only** the four `/ws/*` paths to the agent - never any agent REST route.
  - **`auth_request` (WS_REQUIRE_SESSION=true)** makes nginx validate the webapp session
    cookie against `/api/auth/me` before allowing any WS upgrade, so reaching those
    agent sockets requires a logged-in user - not just a network position - on top of the
    app-layer ws-ticket.
  - the operator **IP allowlist / basic-auth gate** sits in front of everything.
- The webapp trusts `X-Internal-Key` as a service-to-service **auth bypass** and injects
  `X-User-Id` / `X-User-Role` downstream after auth. nginx **strips these inbound headers** on
  every request (plus `X-Powered-By`) so a client can never spoof identity or bypass auth.
- There is **no login rate-limit or lockout** in the app. nginx supplies `limit_req` on
  `/api/auth/login` (5r/m) and a general `/api/` limit (30r/s), a per-IP connection cap, and
  slowloris timeouts.
- **Headers:** the webapp sets none of its own, so nginx is authoritative - HSTS, a tightened
  CSP (no `unsafe-eval`; `object-src 'none'`; `base-uri`/`form-action 'self'`), `X-Frame-Options
  DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and COOP/CORP.
- **TLS:** TLS 1.2/1.3 only, modern ECDHE ciphers, `ssl_session_tickets off`, OCSP stapling.
- Every secret must be strong: the deploy runs a **secrets gate** that fails the build on any
  unset/default/short secret (`changeme`, `redamon_secret`, ...). redamon.sh generates them;
  the deploy only verifies.
- `ip_allowlist` (default `GATE_MODE`) is strongly recommended given the powerful
  agent WS surface + root PTY - defense-in-depth on top of the app-layer ws-ticket and login.
- **Reverse shell (4444)** is bound to loopback by the prod overlay and closed at the
  firewall. To catch a *direct* reverse shell during an engagement, set
  `REVSHELL_TARGET_CIDRS` to your RoE target scope and run `./deploy.sh revshell-open`; run
  `./deploy.sh revshell-close` the moment you are done. How it works: `revshell-open` starts a
  transient `socat` forwarder on the host's public IP (`<public-ip>:4444 -> 127.0.0.1:4444`)
  and opens `4444` in ufw to your target CIDRs only. Because `socat` is a **host** listener
  (not a Docker-published port), ufw's source scoping actually applies - a plain ufw rule on
  a Docker-published port would be bypassed by Docker's own iptables chains. A host **reboot
  drops the forwarder**, so 4444 fails closed. The msf handler on 4444 is unauthenticated, so
  it is exposed only to `REVSHELL_TARGET_CIDRS`, never the world; set your payload's LHOST to
  the host's public IP and start the msf handler in RedAmon. (Alternative: a tunnel
  ngrok/chisel to `127.0.0.1:4444` with `TUNNELS_ENABLED=true`; never run a world-open 4444
  and a tunnel at once.)
- If `ENABLE_GVM=true`, the deploy rotates GVM's default `admin/admin` and prints the new
  password once.

### Cloud firewall / Security Group

`deploy.sh` configures the host `ufw`, but on a cloud host your **provider firewall (AWS
Security Group / GCP firewall / Azure NSG) is the reliable outer boundary** — Docker's own
iptables chains can bypass `ufw`, so the cloud firewall is what still protects you if a
loopback re-bind is ever wrong (e.g. a stray `docker compose up` that republishes
`3000`/`8090`/`4444` on `0.0.0.0`). Open **only**:

| Port | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **443/tcp** | your `OPERATOR_ALLOW_CIDRS` (or `0.0.0.0/0` if you rely on the nginx gate) | the app (HTTPS) |
| **80/tcp** | `0.0.0.0/0` | Let's Encrypt ACME challenge + redirect to 443 (required for `TLS_MODE=letsencrypt`) |
| **22/tcp** | your IP only | SSH management |

**Open nothing else.** In particular do **not** open `8090` (agent), `3000` (webapp),
`5432`/`7687`/`7474` (PostgreSQL/Neo4j), or `8000-8016`/`4444`/`8015` (Kali MCP / progress /
tunnel manager / PTY / reverse-shell) — all are loopback-bound and reached only through nginx
on `443`. Opening `8090` would expose the agent's unauthenticated WebSockets (including the
anonymous **root PTY** `/ws/kali-terminal`) and its REST surface directly, bypassing nginx and
its session gate. The browser reaches the agent's WebSockets at `wss://<domain>/ws/…` on `443`
(nginx → `127.0.0.1:8090`), so `8090` never needs to be publicly reachable.

> **nginx runs on the host, not in a container.** It sits **only at the edge** (80/443),
> reverse-proxying to two loopback backends — the **webapp** (`127.0.0.1:3000`, for `/` and
> `/api/*`) and the **agent** (`127.0.0.1:8090`, for the four `/ws/*` paths only). It is **not**
> a middlebox between containers: all internal service-to-service traffic (webapp ↔ agent ↔
> orchestrator ↔ DBs ↔ Kali) flows directly over the Docker bridge networks and never passes
> through nginx.

## First-run walkthrough

1. `cp .env.example .env`; set `HOST_IP`, `DOMAIN`, `SSH_KEY_PATH`, `OPERATOR_ALLOW_CIDRS`,
   `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL`, and `ADMIN_NAME`/`ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Point `DOMAIN`'s
   A-record at `HOST_IP` first (letsencrypt needs it).
2. `./deploy.sh init` -> type `INIT` to confirm the wipe.
3. Watch: teardown -> host bootstrap -> hardening -> clone + patches -> `redamon.sh install`
   (30-60 min build) -> secrets gate -> admin bootstrap -> nginx + TLS -> verify.
4. Verification asserts loopback binds (3000/8090 on 127.0.0.1 only), datastores never
   off-loopback, container health, an admin exists, and `https://<domain>/api/health` -> 200.
5. Log in at `https://<domain>/`.

`DRY_RUN=true ./deploy.sh init` prints the resolved plan without touching the host.

## How the host is bootstrapped

`init` (and `harden`) run a dynamic detect-and-install matrix - each item is probed and
installed only if missing or too old, idempotently: base apt packages (git, openssl, curl,
jq, expect, ...), **Docker Engine + Compose v2 from Docker's official repo** (purging any old
`docker.io`/v1 compose first), the docker service + group membership, nginx, certbot (only
when letsencrypt is used), ufw, fail2ban, unattended-upgrades, an 8 GB swapfile on < 16 GB
hosts, optional Docker DNS, and inotify limits. Nothing is assumed pre-present.

## Update and rollback

`update` is a thin wrapper around `redamon.sh update`: it restores the deploy-time patched
files so the tree is fast-forwardable, runs `git pull --ff-only` + diff-driven selective
rebuild + secret regen (all via redamon.sh, which preserves DB passwords by volume detection),
then re-applies the patches AND rebuilds the webapp image so the baked single-origin WS URL
and Secure-cookie change survive the update (redamon.sh would otherwise rebuild webapp from
the reset, unpatched tree). Finally it re-renders nginx. **All engagement data (Postgres,
Neo4j, reports, GVM feeds, models) lives in named volumes that survive `update`.**

The deploy applies three app-code changes on the host checkout at deploy time (they are not
committed to the app source): the `webapp/Dockerfile` `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_WS_URL` build arg,
the cypherfix WS-origin fix, and the Secure-cookie flip (https only). They live in `patches/`.
The prod compose overlay and these patches are SCP'd to the host and copied into the checkout
by `deploy.sh`, so the deploy works even if `deploy/single-host/` is not committed to the
cloned branch (committing it is still fine and makes the overlay part of the repo history).

Rollback is manual: `git reset --hard <prev>` on the host checkout, then `./deploy.sh update`.

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

- **RAM gate abort** ("need ~8 GB"): provision more RAM, or set `REDAMON_SKIP_RAM_GATE=true`
  (risky) and keep `SWAP_SIZE_GB` on.
- **certbot fails**: `DOMAIN` must resolve to the host and port 80 must be reachable (open it
  in your cloud Security Group / `OPERATOR_ALLOW_CIDRS` must not block the ACME check - LE
  validates from arbitrary IPs, so 80 must be world-open). Use `LETSENCRYPT_STAGING=true` to
  iterate without burning the rate limit.
- **Secrets-gate failure**: a secret is unset/default/short. redamon.sh should have generated
  them; check the server `~/<APP_DIR>/.env`.
- **GVM feed-sync wait**: with `ENABLE_GVM=true`, scans don't work until feeds finish syncing
  (10-20 min after first boot).
- **Never run raw `docker compose up` on the host.** The loopback re-binds hold only while
  the prod overlay is active (`COMPOSE_FILE`). A bare `docker compose up` reloads the base
  file and republishes 3000/8090/4444 on 0.0.0.0 and starts the profile-less GVM stack.
  Always go through `redamon.sh` (which the deploy points at the overlay). `redamon.sh up dev`
  is likewise forbidden here (it hardcodes its own compose files and defeats the overlay).
- **Locked out over SSH**: if you deployed over a password, `ENABLE_SSH_HARDENING` will not
  disable password login. Install a key, then re-run `harden` with key auth to close it.

## The redamon.sh parameter surface

`deploy.sh` never edits `redamon.sh`. It drives it through four channels: the subcommand
(`MODE`), CLI flags on `install`, exported env vars, and keys appended to the server-side
application `.env`.

| `.env` key | Drives |
|---|---|
| `ENABLE_GVM` | `install --gvm` |
| `ENABLE_KB` | `install --kbase` |
| `ENABLE_ZRAM` | `REDAMON_ENABLE_ZRAM=1` |
| `REDAMON_BUILD_PARALLEL` | `REDAMON_BUILD_PARALLEL` (blank -> auto) |
| `DOCKER_BUILD_CACHE_MAX_GB` | `builder.gc.defaultKeepStorage` in `/etc/docker/daemon.json` (blank -> Docker default) |
| `REDAMON_SKIP_RAM_GATE` | `REDAMON_SKIP_RAM_GATE=1` |
| `REDAMON_VERSION` | image build-arg stamp |
| (fixed) | `COMPOSE_FILE` = base + prod overlay, made sticky |
| `APP_DIR` | `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` (do not change between init/update) |
| `ADMIN_*` | first-admin creation on init |
| `NVD_API_KEY`, `KB_EMBEDDING_*`, `TUNNELS_ENABLED` | appended to the server `.env` |

Intentionally hands-off (redamon.sh owns these; the deploy only verifies): `AUTH_SECRET`,
`INTERNAL_API_KEY`, `SCANNER_API_KEY`, `ORCHESTRATOR_API_KEY`, `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`,
`AGENT_WS_TICKET_SECRET`, `TUNNEL_AUTH_TOKEN`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`, and
`SKIP_KB` (derived from the `.kbase-enabled` flag).
