"""
Capture-proxy egress guard (plan §15.3, §20.5).

A new proxy is a new egress path, so it must not become an SSRF pivot into
RedAmon's internal network or a hard-guardrail bypass. This module is the pure,
testable core of that guard; the mitmdump addon calls it in the `request` hook
and blocks anything it refuses.

Two layers:
  1. Internal denylist on the RESOLVED IP (not just the hostname) — RFC1918,
     loopback, link-local, CGNAT, reserved, multicast, unspecified, plus any
     explicitly configured RedAmon service IPs. Checking the resolved IP defeats
     DNS-rebinding (an in-scope name pointing at 169.254.169.254 / 10.x).
  2. Static hard-guardrail on the hostname (.gov/.mil/.edu/.int + exact list),
     via an injected checker so the addon can wire in the bundled hard_guardrail
     module without this module depending on it.

Each block condition is individually toggleable via `EgressPolicy` (surfaced in
Global Settings > TrafficMind). Every toggle defaults to BLOCK, so the out-of-the-
box posture is identical to the original always-on guard; an operator can relax a
specific check (e.g. allow RFC1918 to reach an internal / lab target on a private
Docker network) without weakening the others. The explicit `extra_blocked` IP
denylist (RedAmon's own service IPs) is NOT toggleable; it stays enforced even
when the private-IP category is allowed, so unblocking private targets can never
turn the proxy into an SSRF pivot into RedAmon itself.

Pure stdlib. The addon is responsible for pinning the resolved IP it gets back
here for the actual upstream connection so a TOCTOU re-resolve can't slip past.
