"""
Regression tests for the parallel-scan orchestrator freeze.

Root cause (fixed): docker-py is synchronous, and the async status/log paths
called it directly on the single uvicorn event loop. With several parallel
partial recons + heavy log streaming, those blocking Docker calls starved the
loop, so the orchestrator stopped answering ALL requests (health, status polls,
new scan starts) and the webapp crashed.

Two behaviors are locked in here:
  Fix 1 - status refreshes run in the thread pool (_run_blocking), so a slow
          Docker daemon can never block the event loop, and N runs refresh
          CONCURRENTLY rather than serially.
  Fix 2 - the log-reader liveness reload() is throttled to ~once/30s instead of
          once PER LINE, so a high-volume scan no longer floods the daemon.

These mock Docker; no daemon required.
