"""Shared LLM transient-error classifier + retry helper.

Background. PR #111 added a 3-attempt retry around the fireteam member's
``await llm.ainvoke(...)`` because a single transient error (network blip,
HTTP 529 overload, rate-limit) was terminating an entire fireteam member.
A subsequent review found the same root-cause pattern in two other
places:

  * Root ``think_node`` — calls ``ainvoke`` with NO try/except, so a
    transient there crashes the whole session, not just one specialist.
  * ``guardrail`` — has a 3-attempt loop but with a broad ``except
    Exception`` that retries permanent errors (invalid API key, schema
    bugs) 3x, wasting budget and producing a worse error message.

This module centralizes the classification and retry policy so all three
call sites use identical logic and a new transient exception type added
in the wild (e.g. a future SDK ``RetryableError``) only needs to be added
in one place.

Public API:
  * ``is_transient_llm_error(exc)`` — classify a raised exception
  * ``retry_llm_call(llm, messages, *, label, max_attempts)`` — async
    wrapper around ``llm.ainvoke`` that retries on transient errors
    only, exponential backoff, and re-raises the last exception on
    exhaustion or first non-transient error.
