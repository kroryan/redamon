// S2/E2: constant-time string comparison for secret/key checks.
//
// Runtime-agnostic on purpose: this is imported by BOTH the Edge-runtime
// middleware (where Node's `crypto.timingSafeEqual` is unavailable) and Node
// API routes. A pure-JS XOR-accumulate avoids a byte-by-byte short-circuit
// (which `===` on strings can expose to timing analysis) and is length-guarded.
// The length check returns early, which reveals only the length of a 64-hex
// secret (not its bytes) — an accepted, standard trade-off.
